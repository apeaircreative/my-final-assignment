"""The capstone contract, as deterministic tests against `YourAgent`.

The tests use local doubles rather than a live provider, so these checks run
offline. Each test is named after the contract it guards; run a focused group
with `-k` when diagnosing a failure:

    uv run pytest -k refusal      # unsupported-question behavior
    uv run pytest -k citation     # citation filtering and review fallback
    uv run pytest -k injection    # instructions inside retrieved text
    uv run pytest -k provider     # provider exceptions
    uv run pytest -k timeout      # a provider that hangs
    uv run pytest -k tools        # registered reader tools
    uv run pytest -k memory       # SessionState and MemoryStore
    uv run pytest -k regression   # Rank 1 trace-fidelity regression

The Rank 1 regression test is active. It verifies that a provider failure
preserves retrieval, failed-call, and decision events in the returned trace.
These deterministic tests do not measure live-provider grounded-answer quality
or establish comprehensive prompt-injection coverage.
